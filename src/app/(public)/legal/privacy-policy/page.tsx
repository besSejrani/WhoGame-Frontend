            Websites partly use so-called cookies. Cookies do not cause any
            damage to your computer and do not contain viruses. Cookies serve to
            make our offer more user-friendly, effective and secure. Cookies are

            Most of the cookies we use are so-called “session cookies”. They are
            automatically deleted after the end of your visit. Other cookies
            remain stored on your terminal device until you delete them. These
            cookies allow us to recognize your browser on your next visit.

            You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting
            of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the
            acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general and activate
            the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. If

            storing cookies for the technically error-free and optimized
            provision of its services. As far as other cookies (e.g. cookies to
            analyze your browsing behavior) are stored, they are treated
            separately in this privacy policy.

            The provider of this site automatically collects and stores
            information in so-called server log files, which your browser

              <li>browser type and browser version</li>
              <li>Operating system used</li>
